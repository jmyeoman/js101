how to create subarrays

Notes for possible changes
1. use a prompt helper function X
2. Convert numbers to spaces X
3. help display with numbered squares
4. trim square choice inputs
5. change reset board to initialize board
6. If I use spaces I have to change valid choice function 
7. refactor play again function to switch statement
8. replay is repeating the trimmed value X
9. Create empty squares array to check and give options if changing to spaces
10. Use INITIALIZED_MARKER constant for spaces
11. Use HUMAN_ MARKER for X and COMPUTER_MARKER for O
